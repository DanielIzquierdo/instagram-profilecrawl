The documentary also explores the friendships between Dr. Denis Mukwege (2016 Nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize), radical playwright and activist Eve Ensler (The Vagina Monolgoues) and human rights activist - and Director of the City of Joy - Christine Schuler-Deschryver, as they join forces to create this safe haven in the middle of violence-torn Eastern DRC. \nIt is a powerful and beautiful film about the power of the human spirit and I urge you to seek it out: http://drc.vday.org/about-city-of-joy",

We discussed the issues girls face in Malawi and how organisations like @CAMFED, @UNWOMEN and the Malawi Girl Guides Association are helping them overcome these challenges. There is lots of work to be done, and more resources are desperately needed, but I‚Äôm hopeful for the future after seeing the enthusiasm these young women have for change. I know they will be holding President Mutharika to his commitment to end child marriage in Malawi within five years! #goal5\n\nMy jacket and trousers are from @edun. The sustainable organic cotton canvas material is sourced from a mill in South Africa. The material is untreated which avoids any harmful chemical treatments or finishing processes, which is much better for the environment.\n\nShoes were by @ancientgreeksandals. They are handmade locally by skilled craftsmen in Greece using traditional techniques that have existed for centuries. The chemical free, natural tan leather ages beautifully with time and wear. Perfect for #30wears!\n\nI‚Äôm rewearing recycled jewellery from @allbluesofficial #30wears\n\nPS. You may have noticed me talking about my clothes recently - I‚Äôm trying to be conscious about where my clothes come from and also about the people who make them. Just in case you wondering! (I‚Äôm not being paid by brands to do this btw!) All fashion info verified by @ecoage",

Thank you to all the traditional leaders who are implementing President Mutharika's policies - especially Chief Kachindamoto (she‚Äôs in the photo with me, she‚Äôs formidable and has been nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Terminator‚Äù!). She gave me such a warm welcome today. She has implemented the annulment of so many child marriages and restored the futures of these girls. With the help and collaboration of her local chiefs, mothers‚Äô groups and religious leaders she has managed to annul almost 1500 child marriages, sending the girls back to school. President Mutharika has committed to make child marriage a thing of the past in Malawi within the next five years. It was amazing to be on the ground with @UNWomen and Chief Kachindamoto to witness their work!\n\nMy @tomenyc white shirt is made from organic cotton and is part of their 'White Shirt Project‚Äô campaign. The project was conceived in 2014 to raise funds and awareness for the Freedom for All charity, which is fighting human trafficking and modern day slavery. \nThe silk skirt is by @zady. Zady partnered with @cocccon_prakesh, founded in 2012 by Chandra Prakash Jha, a fashion designer who wanted to help his community through fairer wages and a safer, more sustainable process. Instead of using toxic pesticides on the plants that the silkworm caterpillars eat, the farmers protect the trees by covering them with mosquito nets to protect the leaves from harmful birds and insects. Then the silk is brought to New York where expert sewers in New York‚Äôs famed Garment District create each piece. \nSandals by @nisoloshoes. The sandals were made by a team of expert shoemakers in Trujillo, Peru in a factory owned and operated by Nisolo that celebrates fair trade wages, safe working conditions, healthcare for all employees, and financial literacy & wellness training.\n\nAll fashion info verified by @ecoage",

Each piece is handmade by skilled craftsmen and Monique partners with artisans around the world to support traditional craftsmanship and cultural heritage including the Arctic Circle, Colombia, French Polynesia, Guatemala, Norway, Peru and the Philippines. Monique Pean is a member of the #nodirtygold campaign and a supporter of the #tooprecioustowear campaign. In honour of Earth Day, every April the brand donates proceeds from jewellery sales to @treesforthefuture which helps communities alleviate poverty, affects positive social change and improves both local and global environments by working with farming communities along environmentally degraded and highly travelled trade corridors.",
